# sparkbars

A purposedly simple implementation of sparkbars that can plot negative and 
positive values.  

## Installation

sparkbars is not con CRAN yet, but you can install the developement version
from GitHub with:

```r
remotes::install_github("eliocamp/sparkbars")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(sparkbars)
x <- rnorm(10)
sparkbars(x)
```

Inline: 
`r sparkbars(x)`

. Looks bad
